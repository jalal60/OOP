Abstract class:
- Abstract class comes under partial abstraction.
- Abstract classes can maintain abstract methods and non abstract methods.
- In abstract classes, we can create the variables.
- In abstract classes, we can use any access specifier.
- By using 'extends' keyword we can access the abstract class features from derived class.
- Multiple inheritance is not possible.

Interface:
- Interface comes under fully abstraction.
- Interfaces can maintain only abstract methods.
- In interfaces, we can't create the variables.
- In interface, we can use only public access specifier.
- By using 'implement' keyword we can get interface from derived class.
- By using interfaces multiple inheritance is possible.

PHP - Interfaces vs. Abstract Classes
-------------------------------------
= Interfaces cannot have properties, while abstract classes can
= All interface methods must be public, while abstract class methods is public or protected
= All methods in an interface are abstract, so they cannot be implemented in code and the abstract keyword is not necessary
= Classes can implement an interface while inheriting from another class at the same time
